# Gravity Simulation
Simulates the behavior of objects in space with gravity. Goal is to find the necessary parameters for a (somewhat) stable gravity system via genetic-algorithm-enhancement.

The project consists of three main parts:
- UI and graphical display,
- gravitation simulation and calculation on given parameters,
- genetically enhancing algorithm to find the necessary parameters which create one or more (somewhat) stable gravitational systems.

## UI and graphical display
UI and graphical display are based on the Processing 3 library and contain statistics and easy-to-observe viewing of what is happening. Configuration menus help understand what is happening and observe.

## Gravitation simulation and calculation
Calculates how the different object react under given circumstances and provides the graphical display with all necessary information to show the current state of the simulation. Parameters are given / set externally.

## Genetically enhancing algorithm
The genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal parameters to find as stable gravitational systems as possible.

# Dependencies
This project uses the Processing 3 Java core, available on the [processing website](https://processing.org/).
